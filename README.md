#### About

Code Runner is an evolution of my previous project [Horse Racer](https://kimmknight.github.io/HorseRacer/) which is a tribute to the 1986 Mac game *Horse Race*.

Code Runner is still in an experimental stage of development.

Currently, there are only a limited number of projects/upgrades. I would like to add many more and perhaps a prestige feature.

I am also still tweaking parameters relating to speed and randomness to try and make the game well balanced.

#### Help

There is a Getting Started Guide and Quick Reference available in-game.

You might also want to check out [code snippets](https://kimmknight.github.io/CodeRunner/docs/docs.html?doc=codesnippets.md).
